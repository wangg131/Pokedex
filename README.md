## Pokedex
Search for your favorite Pok√©manz by name or type(s). The first 151 will be available for sure, since we all know that the O.G generation is the best. Including the monsters in subsequent generations TBA.

## What is the goal of the project?
- To be able to search for Pokemon by name and/or type.

## Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
- Myself and for whoever likes Pokemon

## What are your personal learning goals?
- I am using this project as a way to learn more about Javascript and Jquery while strengthening the knowledge that I gained from the past two weeks of learning. I will consume an API via Javascript to pull up a Pokemon's information.
- I originally wanted to demonstrate my knowledge of Ruby on Rails for the bulk of the project and use Javascript/Jquery as nice "extras", but I decided to go with latter. This is because I'm not envisioning any functionality for users to persist any information. If I do want to add functionality for users to be able to save information to the database, I will use Ruby to do that. `QUESTION:` Should I be using Ruby on Rails + MVC pattern???

## What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
- Technologies:
  - Pokemon API
  - Front-end: Javascript, Jquery (framework), HTML, CSS
- Patterns: Potential closures with Javascript?.. RESTFUL API calls

## What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
- Not exactly sure what this question means...
- Not sure if I should/could be using Ruby on Rails + MVC without compromising efficiency of just using Javascript.

## What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
- Being able to successfully search a Pokemon by its name or type(s). Also want to include functionaltiy for users to be able to get list of all pokemon by type.

## Create a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.
